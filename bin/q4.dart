// What is Lambda Function?-
// Does Dart have a syntax for declaring interfaces?-
// Explain the purpose of the final keyword in Dart.
// - What is the purpose of async in Dart?


//1-  is a small, unnamed function that can be defined in a single line.
// Lambda functions are often used for short operations

//2-Yes, Dart does support interfaces, but it doesn't have a specific keyword for declaring them. Instead, any class can act as an interface.
// In Dart, when you define a class as abstract,
// it can be implemented by other classes,
// and those classes must provide implementations for all the methods defined in the interface class.

//3- final keyword is used to declare a variable that can't be reassigned (in runtime).

//4-the async keyword is used to define asynchronous functions,
// allowing you to write non-blocking code that can perform long-running operations (like dataBase, network requests,) without freezing the user interface.
